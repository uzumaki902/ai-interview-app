          This app gives you a realistic mock interview experience with an animated AI interviewer. Create an interview from your dashboard using your resume or a job description. The AI avatar will speak each question out loud, listen to your answer using your microphone, and show the conversation as a chat transcript. After you finish, you’ll receive feedback with a score and suggestions. Everything runs on free browser technologies—no paid APIs—so you can practice unlimited times.
